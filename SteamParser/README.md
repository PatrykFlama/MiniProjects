# Steam Purchase History Parser

This is simple program for interpreting Steam purchase history, directly from website (account->details->purchase history)    
It displays some statistics and saves the data to a CSV file

## How to use
Simply copy purchase data from Steam purchase history page and paste it into the `purchase_history.txt` file.    
Then run the script with `python steam_parser.py`.


## TODO/Future work
- [ ] Possibly it would be better to use HTML page (for example with some ready parser) instead of copy-pasting text
